/* Scenario: you need to write a function that must require 2 arguments, lets say division.
    Problem: In JavaScript, if we do not provide both arguments, the result of division will simply result in NaN, which is not desired.
              If the programmer fails to provide all required arguments, 
              ideally the console should spit out an error that points out which argument hasnt been provided.
              
    Solution: we can simply define a require function that contains custom error in case the variable is not provided.
*/


const require = (param) => {
  return new Error (`${param} is not defined`);
}


const divide = (require(a),require(b)) => return a/b;
